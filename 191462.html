				<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>K/DA is also a virtual band in real-life comprised of League of Legends champions which are performed by musicians such as: Bea Miller, Jaira Burns, Madison Beer, Miyeon, Soyeon, and Wolftyla. Each member of the band has a skin corresponding to their K/DA alter-ego (with Evelynn and Kai'Sa having two different artists), which is styled after modern pop music.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">Kai'sa</h4>
							<p class="card-text">Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the fearless hunter of the Void Crest known as Kai'Sa. She did not descend from tribal warriors hardened by generations of battle, nor was she summoned from distant lands to fight the unknowable menace lurking beneath Shurima CrestShurima. Rather, she was just an ordinary girl, born to loving parents who called the unforgiving southern deserts their home. This was where she would spend her days playing with friends, and her nights dreaming about her place in the world.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">Ahri</h4>
							<p class="card-text">She has no clue as to the history of her vastayan tribe—or their place among the rest—save for the twin gemstones she has worn her entire life. In fact, her earliest memories are of running with icefoxes in the northern reaches of Shon-Xan. Though she knew she was not one of them, they clearly saw her as something of a kindred spirit, and came to accept her within the pack.
							In that wild, predatory existence, Ahri nonetheless felt a deeper connection to the forests around her. In time, she came to understand that this was the magic of the vastaya that coursed through every fiber of her being, and the realm of spirits that lay beyond. With no one to teach her, instead she learned to call upon this power in her own ways—most often using it to quicken her reflexes in pursuit of prey. If she was careful and close enough, she also found she might soothe a panicked deer, so that it remained serene and calm even as she and her packmates sank their teeth into its flesh.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">Akali</h4>
							<p class="card-text">Ionia has always been a land of wild magic, its vibrant people and powerful spirits seeking to live in harmony… but sometimes this peaceful equilibrium does not come easily. Sometimes it needs to be kept in check.
							The Kinkou are the self-appointed keepers of Ionia’s sacred balance. The order’s loyal acolytes walk the spirit and material realms, mediating conflicts between them and, when necessary, intervening by force. Born among their ranks was Akali, daughter of Mayym Jhomen Tethi, the renowned Fist of Shadow. Mayym and her partner Tahno raised their daughter within the Kinkou Order, under the watchful leadership of Great Master Kusho, the Eye of Twilight.</p>

							<h4 class="card-title">Evelynn</h4>
							<p class="card-text">Evelynn was not always a skilled huntress. She began eons ago, as something primordial, shapeless, and barely sentient. This nascent wisp of shadow existed, numb and unroused by any stimulation, for centuries. It might have remained so, had the world not been upended by conflict. The Rune Wars, as they would come to be known, brought an era of mass suffering the world had never known.
							As people across Runeterra Crest Runeterra began to experience a vast array of pain, anguish, and loss, the shadow stirred. The nothingness it had known for so long had been replaced by the manic vibrations of an agonized world. The creature quivered with excitement.</p>
